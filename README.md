## Virtual Casino - A Casino Simulator

This C project simulates the real-life casino where people come to gamble money. There are three games - Roulette, Slot Machine and Craps.
Chips or casino tokens are small discs used as terms of currency in casinos. You can buy a chip for $11 and sell it for $10.

### Roulette:
Roulette is a game in which a ball is dropped on to a revolving wheel with numbered compartments from 1 to 36, the player betting on the number at which the
ball comes to rest.
There are three choices given to the user:
1. Bet if the ball lands on an even number or an odd number
2. Bet if the ball lands on high (1 - 18) or low (19 - 36)
3. Bet on a specific number
For 1 and 2, if the player wins, he/she recieves a total return of twice the chips he/she bet. In case of 3, if the player wins, he/she recieves a total return of 36 times the chips he/she bet.

### Slot Machine:
Slot machine contains three random number generators. The player will bet on a number from 0 to 9. If all the three generators show the same number entered by the user, the user wins 50 times the chips he/she bet.

### Craps:
Craps is a dice-game.
1) Roll a pair of fair six-sided dice.
2) If you roll a 7 or 11, you win!
3) If you roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose.
4) Otherwise, record what you've rolled. Let this sum be k; also known as your point.
5) If you rolled a point, continue rolling the pair of dice until you get either your point (k) or a sum of seven on the two dice.
6) If k comes up first, you win!
7) If 7 comes up first, you lose.
The player recieves a total return of twice the chips he/she bet.
